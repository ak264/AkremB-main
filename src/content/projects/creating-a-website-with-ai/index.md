## The AI-Powered Web Development Process

This project explores how artificial intelligence can speed up and enhance the web development process. I used various AI tools to help design, code, and deploy a modern website.

## Tools Used

- **Design**: AI image generation for visuals and mockups
- **Content**: AI writing assistants for copy
- **Code**: AI code generation for frontend components
- **Deployment**: Automated CI/CD pipeline

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that AI-generated code followed best practices and maintained consistent quality. I developed a review system that balanced AI efficiency with human oversight.

## Results

The final website was completed in 50% less time than traditional development while maintaining high quality and performance scores.
