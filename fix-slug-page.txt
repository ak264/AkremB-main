Here is a plan to locate and fix the issue:

1. We need to check the [...slug].astro file in the project directory
2. We previously fixed the frontmatter date formats in the markdown files but the error still occurs
3. There might be additional date handling in the project slug page template

Let's modify the project slug page to handle potential date issues more robustly by adding a safeguard for the pubDate.toISOString call.
