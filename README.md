# What's the big idea?
I am building this site as an experiment & chance to learn the potential capabilities of "vibe-coding." Years ago, the intrigue of Webflow & the no-code space drew me in and had me create a blog, but I never found the flexibility promised to be as easily editable as I would have liked. This project allowed me to build something with a high probability of a successful outcome. Would I have added more customization? Yes, but Chatty (Chat-GPT) and I weren't always vibing through my experiments. Did I add tools to a website that weren't in the original template? Yes—I was mindblown when I created a filter for projects & blogs with a screenshot alone 🤯.

Before this project, GitHub scared me; now I push commits like a bench press 💪🏾!

# Acknowledging Success & Failures
As good as my intention may have been, this code likely houses errors much like a personal shed built by hand, may house a few loose ends, and has space for spider webs. Still, it's a low-risk experiment that's allowed me to level up significantly compared to where I started. In fact, that's exactly where I see the greatest opportunity with Generative AI—not just in what it can do for us, but in the versions of ourselves it can help us become.

I celebrate the errors in my code; they're valuable lessons I'll reflect on further down my journey, as much as I celebrate putting this online (I used to pay $30/month to Webflow; now, with GitHub Pages, it's free. That's a win!).

Thanks for stopping by my readme; I plan to keep this site active for at least 3–6 months as I continue my builder's journey.
